# Vela — Server

Backend for **Vela**, an open-source contactless-payment prototype built around [Stellar](https://stellar.org) testnet.

The backend contains payment-request validation and persistence, passkey-based payment authorization, and a Stellar integration service for transaction building, submission and confirmation polling. Connecting these services into a complete client-to-network payment flow remains active development work.

> **Mobile client:** The Expo app lives in a separate repository — [VelaPayments/vela-payments](https://github.com/VelaPayments/vela-payments).

## How Vela uses Stellar

Stellar is the intended settlement network for Vela payments. The product goal is a short path from sharing a payment request to approving and confirming an XLM or issued-asset transfer. NFC carries the request between devices; funds move through a signed Stellar transaction and network confirmation.

This repository implements the server-side building blocks with `@stellar/stellar-sdk`:

| Capability                  | Implementation                                                                                                                            | Role in Vela                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Network access              | [StellarModule](src/stellar/stellar.module.ts)                                                                                            | Configures Horizon and Stellar RPC clients, the network passphrase and the USDC issuer                               |
| Accounts and assets         | [StellarService](src/stellar/stellar.service.ts) — `getAccount`, `resolveAsset`                                                           | Loads source accounts; resolves native XLM or USDC by its configured issuer                                          |
| Payment construction        | `StellarService.buildPaymentTransaction`                                                                                                  | Builds an unsigned `Operation.payment` transaction with fee, network passphrase, optional memo and a bounded timeout |
| Submission and confirmation | `StellarService.submitTransaction`, `pollTransactionStatus`                                                                               | Accepts signed XDR, submits through Horizon and polls for an ingested outcome with bounded retries                   |
| RPC support                 | `StellarService.getHealth`, `simulateTransaction`                                                                                         | Checks provider health and exposes transaction simulation at the service level                                       |
| Payment requests            | [Contract validator](src/contracts/payment-request.v1.ts) and [request service](src/modules/payment-requests/payment-requests.service.ts) | Validates supported assets, amount strings, recipient format and timestamps before persistence                       |

The transaction helpers have mocked regression coverage in [stellar.service.spec.ts](src/stellar/stellar.service.spec.ts). They are not yet exposed as a complete public settlement API, and a completed real-device transfer has not been demonstrated. WebAuthn authorizes an application payment action; Stellar transaction signatures and network confirmation remain separate parts of the intended flow.

### Work that advances the Stellar integration

- [Align the client/server payment payload](https://github.com/VelaPayments/vela-server/issues/3) so NFC requests can pass server validation consistently.
- [Strengthen memo byte limits and confirmation polling coverage](https://github.com/VelaPayments/vela-server/issues/52).
- [Protect authorization failure ordering](https://github.com/VelaPayments/vela-server/issues/64) before connecting authorization to submission.

The current prototype targets Stellar testnet. XLM is represented as the native asset; issued assets are identified by both code and issuer, so the USDC issuer must match the selected network. See [Stellar's asset model](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/fundamentals/stellar-data-structures/assets).

## Project status

Vela is an early Stellar testnet prototype under active development. It is not ready for real funds or production payment use.

| Area             | Current status                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web preview      | [Live UI preview](https://vela-payments.vercel.app/); browser passkey setup and NFC are unavailable                     |
| Mobile           | Native onboarding, wallet and receive-flow code; requires a development build and physical-device validation            |
| Sending payments | Client Send screen is a scaffold; end-to-end payment completion is not demonstrated                                     |
| Authentication   | Client auth uses local challenges and placeholder API responses; server verification integration remains unfinished     |
| Shared payload   | Client and server currently use different type/timestamp formats; reconciliation is tracked in the contribution backlog |
| Compatibility    | Passkey RP domain and app/storage/NFC identifiers are pending a coordinated migration decision                          |

See [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Wave preparation](docs/wave-readiness.md) for current priorities. Architecture/build-plan documents include intended features and must not be treated as proof of completed functionality.

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace placeholders with your values. Variable groups:

- **App** — `NODE_ENV`, `PORT`, `API_PREFIX`, `CORS_ORIGINS`
- **Database** — `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL` (Supabase PostgreSQL)
- **Supabase Auth** — `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- **Stellar** — network, Horizon/RPC URLs, USDC issuer, network passphrase
- **WebAuthn** — RP ID, name, and origin (must match the Expo client)
- **Payments / rate limiting** — submit timeouts, poll intervals, throttle settings

See `.env.example` for the full list with placeholder values.

## Security notes

- Never commit `.env` or real secrets to the repository.
- Do not log JWTs, service role keys, or raw WebAuthn challenges.
- Hybrid auth model: Supabase session for API access + WebAuthn for payment approval.
